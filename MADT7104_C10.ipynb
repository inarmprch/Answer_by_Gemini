It really comes down to what qualities you consider \"greatest.\" Different people will have different criteria.\n> \n> Here's why it's so hard to answer and some of the factors people consider:\n> \n> *   **Subjectivity:** What makes someone \"great\" is entirely subjective. Is it their intelligence, their compassion, their artistic talent, their impact on history, or something else?\n> *   **Perspective:** Different cultures and time periods have different values. Someone considered great in one era might not be in another.\n> *   **Complexity:** Human beings are complex. No one person embodies all the positive qualities. Even those considered \"great\" likely had flaws.\n> *   **Defining \"Greatness\":** Do we measure greatness by positive impact, by influence, by achievement, or a combination?\n> \n> **Some potential candidates and the qualities they are known for (keeping in mind this is just a small sampling):**\n> \n> *   **Philosophers/Thinkers:**\n>     *   **Socrates:** Known for his wisdom, his questioning of societal norms, and his commitment to truth (even at the cost of his life).\n>     *   **Plato:** Philosopher, student of Socrates, founder of the Academy in Athens. Known for his impact on Western thought.\n>     *   **Aristotle:** Philosopher, scientist. He taught Alexander the Great, making him influential in the ancient world.\n> *   **Religious/Spiritual Figures:**\n>     *   **Jesus Christ:** Founder of Christianity, revered for his teachings of love, compassion, and forgiveness.\n>     *   **Buddha:** Founder of Buddhism, known for his teachings on enlightenment and the end of suffering.\n>     *   **Muhammad:** Founder of Islam, seen by Muslims as the last prophet of God.\n> *   **Scientists/Inventors:**\n>     *   **Leonardo da Vinci:** Renaissance polymath (artist, scientist, inventor, etc.) His genius spanned many fields.\n>     *   **Isaac Newton:** Physicist and mathematician, formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, revolutionizing science.\n>     *   **Albert Einstein:** Physicist, developed the theory of relativity, transformed our understanding of the universe.\n> *   **Political/Social Leaders:**\n>     *   **Abraham Lincoln:** U.S. President, led the country through the Civil War and abolished slavery.\n>     *   **Mahatma Gandhi:** Leader of the Indian independence movement, used nonviolent resistance to achieve political change.\n>     *   **Nelson Mandela:** Anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist.\n> *   **Artists/Creative Minds:**\n>     *   **William Shakespeare:** Widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language.\n>     *   **Michelangelo:** Renaissance artist, painter, sculptor, architect and poet.\n>     *   **Ludwig van Beethoven:** Influential composer, who composed in classical and romantic periods of music.\n> \n> **How to think about it:**\n> \n> Instead of trying to definitively name \"the greatest,\" it's more helpful to:\n> \n> 1.  **Consider your values:** What qualities do you admire most?\n> 2.  **Research individuals:** Learn about people who have significantly impacted the world in ways that align with those values.\n> 3.  **Appreciate the diversity of human achievement:** Recognize that greatness comes in many forms.\n> \n> So, the \"greatest human\" is a matter of personal opinion and depends entirely on the metrics you use to evaluate people and their accomplishments. I hope this helps you formulate your own opinion.\n"
